Below is the approach I have followed to achieve the given coding challenge;


Step1 : Initialize nearestBlockIndex of first block and the nearestdistance maximum possible value 

Step2 : Loop through each block

Step3 : Initialize the maxDistance to walk from this block to 0

Step4 : Loop through each requirements

Step5 : If requirements are not present in the current block, Then iterate until find the nearest block that is having requirements

Step6 : If the requirements are not present in any subsequent blocks, Set the distance to the maximum possible value

Step7 : Update the maximum distance to walk for this block if necessary

Step8 : If the maximum distance to walk for this block is less than the nearestDistance , Then update the  nearestDistance and nearestBlockIndex

Step9 : Finally it returns to the nearestBlockIndex.
